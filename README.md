Cryptocurrrency exchange can be done in many manual ways sometimes it can also be done with the help of arbitrage bots here are how I proceeded to make my own arbitrage bot.

First it checkscrypto currency prices and then secondly it trades crypto currency it either buys it or sells it and trades crypto and it does it all on theblockchain everything's powered by smartcontracts.

STEP 1: Go to your terminal and type git clone https://github.com/Thee-sage/My-first-cryptocurrency-bot and cd into it and you would have all the files ready for your  bot.

That is it.
