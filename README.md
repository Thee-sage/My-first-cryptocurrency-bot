Cryptocurrrency exchange can be done in many manual ways sometimes it can also be done with the help of arbitrage bots here are how I proceeded to make my own arbitrage bot.

First it checks crypto currency prices and then secondly it trades crypto currency it either buys it or sells it and trades crypto and it does it all on the blockchain everything's powered by smartcontracts.

STEP 1: Go to your terminal and type "git clone https://github.com/Thee-sage/My-first-cryptocurrency-bot" and cd into it and you would have all the files ready for your  bot.

STEP 2: Read through the comments above the code.

STEP 3: Add your wallet address, private key, RPC URL which would be https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY in your .env file which is basically your env.example file . (Make a infura account if you haven't already and add ropsten test ethers on your wallet.)
